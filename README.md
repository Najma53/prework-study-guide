# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This guide was created for me as a boot camp user with zero coding experience and just a basic knowledge of how to use computers and laptops. It contains few notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- My motivation /inspiration was to know I can do this regardless of my non existence experience.
- I build this project solely to prove myself I can do this given the instructions.
- If anyone is in my situation, dont lose hope you can do it.
- I have learnt to debug, follow logical pattern and hopefully remember the commands.



If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
